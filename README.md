## 🔧 Features

- **Multi-Floor Network Topology**: Structured layout for classrooms on several building levels.
- **Subnetting & IP Scheme**: Logical addressing for scalable and organized device management.
- **Static Routing**: Enables reliable communication between routers and network segments.
- **Device Configuration**: Switches, routers, and end devices assigned with realistic parameters.
- **Connectivity Verification**: Includes successful ping tests between workstations and servers.
